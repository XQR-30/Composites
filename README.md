Composite spectra based on the E-XQR-30 sample

File list:
EXQR-30-composite-total.txt 	  composite spectrum for the total E-XQR-30 sample, including 42 quasars
EXQR-30-composite-high-EW.txt		composite spectrum for E-QXR-30 quasars with rest-frame CIV EW >14.5 A, including 21 quasars
EXQR-30-composite-low-EW.txt		composite spectrum for E-QXR-30 quasars with rest-frame CIV EW <14.5 A, including 21 quasars

File structure: 
Column 1 = rest-frame wavelength [in units of A] 
Column 2 = flux [arbitrary units], normalized to the median continuum flux in the rest-frame  interval 1600-1610 A


Spectral resolution: 50 km/s
